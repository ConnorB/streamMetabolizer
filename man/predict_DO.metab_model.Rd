\title{Make dissolved oxygen predictions from a fitted metab_model.}
\usage{
\method{predict_DO}{metab_model}(metab_model, date_start = NA,
  date_end = NA, day_start = get_specs(metab_model)$day_start,
  day_end = get_specs(metab_model)$day_end, ..., attach.units = FALSE,
  use_saved = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{metab_model}{A metabolism model, implementing the 
metab_model_interface, to use in predicting metabolism}

\item{date_start}{Date or a class convertible with as.Date. The first date 
(inclusive) for which to report DO predictions. If NA, no filtering is 
done.}

\item{date_end}{Date or a class convertible with as.Date. The last date 
(inclusive) for which to report DO predictions. If NA, no filtering is 
done.}

\item{day_start}{start time (inclusive) of a day's data in number of hours 
from the midnight that begins the date. For example, day_start=-1.5 
indicates that data describing 2006-06-26 begin at 2006-06-25 22:30, or at 
the first observation time that occurs after that time if day_start doesn't
fall exactly on an observation time. For instantaneous (unit value)
predictions, day_end - day_start can be any length you want, though it
probably makes sense to stick to the bounds you used to fit the model.}

\item{day_end}{end time (exclusive) of a day's data in number of hours from 
the midnight that begins the date. For example, day_end=30 indicates that 
data describing 2006-06-26 end at the last observation time that occurs 
before 2006-06-27 06:00. For instantaneous (unit value) predictions, 
day_end - day_start can be any length you want, though it probably makes
sense to stick to the bounds you used to fit the model.}

\item{...}{Other arguments passed to class-specific implementations of 
\code{predict_DO}}

\item{attach.units}{logical. Should units be attached to the output?}

\item{use_saved}{logical. Is it OK to use predictions that were saved with 
the model?}
}
