\description{
This function requires \code{chron}, a package that is not formally required
by the \code{streamMetabolizer} package overall. Ensure that you have
\code{chron} installed or install it with \code{install.packages('chron')}.
}
\details{
This function produces a version of the French Creek dataset that agrees as
much as possible with raw code from Bob Hall, for comparison to functions
written in streamMetabolizer. Line numbers in comments (L22, etc.) refer to
those in 'stream_metab_usa/starter_files/One station metab code.R'
}
