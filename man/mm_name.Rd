\arguments{
\item{type}{character. The model type. Options:
\itemize{
  \item \code{mle}: maximum likelihood estimation (see also \code{\link{metab_mle}}) 
  \item \code{bayes}: bayesian hierarchical models \code{\link{metab_bayes}}
  \item \code{night}: nighttime regression (see also \code{\link{metab_night}}) 
  \item \code{Kmodel}: regression of \emph{daily} estimates of
  \code{K600.daily} versus discharge, time, etc., usually for 3-phase 
  estimation of K alone (by MLE or nighttime regression), K vs discharge 
  (using this model), and then GPP and ER with fixed K (by MLE) (see also 
  \code{\link{metab_Kmodel}})
  \item \code{sim}: simulation of \code{DO.obs} 'data' for testing other models (see also \code{\link{metab_sim}})
}}

\item{pool_K600}{character. [How] should the model pool information among 
days to get more consistent daily estimates for K600? Options (see Details
for more):
\itemize{
  \item \code{none}: no pooling of K600
  \item \code{normal}: \eqn{K600 ~ N(mu, sigma)}
  \item \code{linear}: \eqn{K600 ~ N(B[0] + B[1]*Q, sigma)}
  \item \code{binned}: \eqn{K600 ~ N(B[Q_bin], sigma)} where \eqn{mu ~
  N(mu_mu, mu_sigma)} and \eqn{sigma ~ N(sigma_mu, sigma_sigma)}
  \item \code{complete}: applicable only for \code{type='Kmodel'}, which is
  generally used in conjunction with preceding estimates of K (e.g., by
  \code{type='mle'} or \code{type='night'}) and subsequent estimates of GPP
  and ER (e.g., by \code{type='mle'} with daily K600 values specified)
}}

\item{err_obs_iid}{logical. Should IID observation error be included? If not,
the model will be fit to the differences in successive DO measurements, 
rather than to the DO measurements themselves.}

\item{err_proc_acor}{logical. Should autocorrelated process error (with the 
autocorrelation term phi fitted) be included?}

\item{err_proc_iid}{logical. Should IID process error be included?}

\item{ode_method}{character. The method to use in solving the ordinary
differential equation for DO. Options:
\itemize{
  \item \code{euler}, formerly \code{Euler}: the final change in DO from
  t=1 to t=2 is solely a function of GPP, ER, DO, etc. at t=1
  \item \code{trapezoid}, formerly \code{pairmeans}: the final change in DO
  from t=1 to t=2 is a function of the mean values of GPP, ER, etc. across
  t=1 and t=2.
  \item for \code{type='mle'}, options also include \code{rk2} and any 
  character method accepted by \code{\link[deSolve]{ode}} in the 
  \code{deSolve} package (\code{lsoda}, \code{lsode}, \code{lsodes},
  \code{lsodar}, \code{vode}, \code{daspk}, \code{rk4}, \code{ode23},
  \code{ode45}, \code{radau}, \code{bdf}, \code{bdf_d}, \code{adams},
  \code{impAdams}, and \code{impAdams_d}; note that many of these have not
  been well tested in the context of \code{streamMetabolizer} models)
}}

\item{GPP_fun}{character. Function dictating how gross primary productivity
(GPP) varies within each day. Options:
\itemize{ 
  \item \code{linlight}: GPP is a linear function of light with an
  intercept at 0 and a slope that varies by day.
    \cr \code{GPP(t) = GPP.daily * light(t) / mean.light}
    \itemize{
      \item \code{GPP.daily}: the daily mean GPP, which is partitioned into
      timestep-specific rates according to the fraction of that day's
      average light that occurs at each timestep (specifically,
      \code{mean.light} is the mean of the first 24 hours of the date's
      data window)
    } 
  \item \code{satlight}: GPP is a saturating function of light.
    \cr \code{GPP(t) = Pmax * tanh(alpha * light(t) / Pmax)}
    \itemize{
      \item \code{Pmax}: the maximum possible GPP
      \item \code{alpha}: a descriptor of the rate of increase of GPP as a function of light
    }
  \item \code{satlightq10temp}: GPP is a saturating function of light and
  an exponential function of temperature.
    \cr \code{GPP(t) = Pmax * tanh(alpha * light(t) / Pmax) * 1.036 ^ (temp.water(t) - 20)}
    \itemize{
      \item \code{Pmax}: the maximum possible GPP
      \item \code{alpha}: a descriptor of the rate of increase of GPP as a function of light
    }
  \item \code{NA}: applicable only to \code{type='Kmodel'}, for which GPP is not estimated
}}

\item{ER_fun}{character. Function dictating how ecosystem respiration (ER)
varies within each day. Options:
\itemize{
  \item \code{constant}: ER is constant over every timestep of the day.
    \cr \code{ER(t) = ER.daily} 
    \itemize{
      \item \code{ER.daily}: the daily mean ER, which is equal to instantaneous ER at all times
    }
  \item \code{q10temp}: ER at each timestep is an exponential function of
  the water temperature and a temperature-normalized base rate.
    \cr \code{ER(t) = ER20 * 1.045 ^ (temp.water(t) - 20)}
    \itemize{
      \item \code{ER20}: the value of ER when \code{temp.water} is 20 degrees C
    }
  \item \code{NA}: applicable only to \code{type='Kmodel'}, for which ER is not estimated
}}

\item{deficit_src}{character. From what DO estimate (observed or modeled)
should the DO deficit be computed? Options:
\itemize{
  \item \code{DO_mod}: the DO deficit at time t will be {(DO.sat(t) -
  DO_mod(t))}, the difference between the equilibrium-saturation value and
  the current best estimate of the true DO concentration at that time
  \item \code{DO_obs}: the DO deficit at time t will be {(DO.sat(t) -
  DO.obs(t))}, the difference between the equilibrium-saturation value and
  the measured DO concentration at that time
  \item \code{DO_obs_filter}: applicable only to \code{type='night'}: a
  smoothing filter is applied over the measured DO.obs values before
  applying nighttime regression
  \item \code{NA}: applicable only to \code{type='Kmodel'}, for which DO deficit is not estimated
}}

\item{engine}{character. With which function or software should the model
fitting be done?
\itemize{
  \item for \code{type='mle'}: \code{nlm} only (the default)
  \item for \code{type='bayes'}: \code{stan} only (the default), an
  external software package that runs MCMC chains for Bayesian models (see
  http://mc-stan.org)
  \item for \code{type='night'}: \code{lm} only (the default)
  \item for \code{type='Kmodel'}: \code{mean}, \code{lm}, or \code{loess}
  enable different types of relationships between daily K600 and its
  predictors (nothing, discharge, time, etc.)
  \item for \code{type='sim'}: \code{rnorm} only (the default)
}}

\item{check_validity}{logical. if TRUE, this function checks the resulting
name against \code{mm_valid_names(type)}.}
}
\description{
A \code{model_name} concisely specifies the structure of a metabolism model. 
From a \code{model_name}, an appropriate set of model specifications 
(parameters and runtime options) can be generated with \code{\link{specs}}. 
From a complete \code{specs} list, a metabolism model can be run with 
\code{\link{metab}}.
}
\details{
While the \code{Usage} shows all valid values for each argument, not all 
argument combinations are valid; the combination will also be checked if 
\code{check_validity==TRUE}. For arguments not explicitly specified, defaults
depend on the value of \code{type}: any argument that is not explicitly 
supplied (besides \code{type} and \code{check_validity}) will default to the 
values indicated by \code{mm_parse_name(mm_valid_names(type)[1])}.
