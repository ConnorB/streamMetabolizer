\usage{
\method{get_params}{metab_Kmodel}(metab_model, date_start = NA,
  date_end = NA, uncertainty = c("sd", "ci", "none"), ...,
  use_saved = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{metab_model}{A metabolism model, implementing the 
metab_model_interface, to use in predicting metabolism}

\item{date_start}{Date or a class convertible with as.Date. The first date 
(inclusive) for which to report metabolism predictions. If NA, no filtering
is done.}

\item{date_end}{Date or a class convertible with as.Date. The last date 
(inclusive) for which to report metabolism predictions. If NA, no filtering
is done.}

\item{uncertainty}{character. Should columns for the uncertainty of parameter
estimates be excluded ('none'), reported as standard deviations ('sd'), or 
reported as lower and upper bounds of a 95 percent confidence interval 
('ci')?}

\item{...}{Other arguments passed to class-specific implementations of 
\code{predict_metab}}

\item{use_saved}{logical. Is it OK to use predictions that were saved with 
the model?}
}
\value{
A data.frame of predictions of K600.daily
