mm_filter_hours(data, day_start, day_end)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{a data.frame containing date and solar.time columns (POSIXct)}

\item{day_start}{the start time of each day, inclusive, in hours}

\item{day_end}{the end time of each day, exclusive, in hours}

Within each date (as labeled by the 'date' column of \code{data}, select the 
values of solar.time that are within the time range specified by day_start
