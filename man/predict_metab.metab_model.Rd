\title{Make metabolism predictions from a fitted metab_model.}
\usage{
\method{predict_metab}{metab_model}(metab_model, date_start = NA,
  date_end = NA, day_start = get_specs(metab_model)$day_start,
  day_end = day_start + 24, ..., attach.units = FALSE, use_saved = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{metab_model}{A metabolism model, implementing the 
metab_model_interface, to use in predicting metabolism}

\item{date_start}{Date or a class convertible with as.Date. The first date 
(inclusive) for which to report metabolism predictions. If NA, no filtering
is done.}

\item{date_end}{Date or a class convertible with as.Date. The last date 
(inclusive) for which to report metabolism predictions. If NA, no filtering
is done.}

\item{day_start}{start time (inclusive) of a day's data in number of hours 
from the midnight that begins the date. For example, day_start=-1.5 
indicates that data describing 2006-06-26 begin at 2006-06-25 22:30, or at 
the first observation time that occurs after that time if day_start doesn't
fall exactly on an observation time. For daily metabolism predictions, 
day_end - day_start should probably equal 24 so that each day's estimate is
representative of a 24-hour period.}

\item{day_end}{end time (exclusive) of a day's data in number of hours from 
the midnight that begins the date. For example, day_end=30 indicates that 
data describing 2006-06-26 end at the last observation time that occurs 
before 2006-06-27 06:00. For daily metabolism predictions, day_end -
day_start should probably equal 24 so that each day's estimate is 
representative of a 24-hour period.}

\item{...}{Other arguments passed to class-specific implementations of 
\code{predict_metab}}

\item{attach.units}{logical. Should units be attached to the output?}

\item{use_saved}{logical. Is it OK to use predictions that were saved with 
the model?}
}

reflecting a 95% CI.
