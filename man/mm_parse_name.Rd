\title{Parse a model name into its features}
\usage{
mm_parse_name(model_name, expand = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{model_name}{character: the model name}

\item{expand}{logical: should additional columns such as model_name and
pool_K600_type be added? If expand=TRUE then the result cannot be passed
directly back into mm_name, but the additional columns may be helpful for 
interpreting the model structure.}
}
\description{
Returns a data.frame with one column per model structure detail and one row 
per `model_name` supplied to this function. See \code{?\link{mm_name}} for a 
description of each of the data.frame columns that is returned.
}
\details{
Custom model files (for MCMC) may have additional characters after an 
underscore at the end of the name and before the prefix. For example, 
'b_np_pcpi_eu_ko.stan' and 'b_np_pcpi_eu_ko_v2.stan' are parsed the same; the
_v2 is ignored by this function.
}
\examples{
mm_parse_name(c(mm_name('mle'), mm_name('night'), mm_name('bayes')))
mm_parse_name(c(mm_name('mle'), mm_name('night'), mm_name('bayes')), expand=TRUE)
}
\seealso{
The converse of this function is \code{\link{mm_name}}.
