\usage{
mm_predict_metab_1ply(data_ply, data_daily_ply, day_start, day_end, ply_date,
  ..., model_name)
}
\arguments{
\item{data_ply}{a data.frame containing all relevant, validated modeling data
for a single ply of data. (1 ply ~= 1 date, although the day length has 
been specified by day_start and day_end and may not be exactly 24 hours)}

\item{data_daily_ply}{NULL or a data.frame containing inputs with a daily 
timestep.}

\item{day_start}{start time (inclusive) of a day's data in number of hours 
from the midnight that begins the date. For example, day_start=-1.5 
indicates that data describing 2006-06-26 begin at 2006-06-25 22:30, or at 
the first observation time that occurs after that time if day_start doesn't
fall exactly on an observation time.}

\item{day_end}{end time (exclusive) of a day's data in number of hours from 
the midnight that begins the date. For example, day_end=30 indicates that 
data describing 2006-06-26 end at the last observation time that occurs 
before 2006-06-27 06:00.}

\item{ply_date}{the modal date of this ply of data and data_daily, and the 
date by which this ply should be referred topresent.}

\item{...}{other args that were passed untouched from the function calling 
mm_model_by_ply, through mm_model_by_ply, and finally to this function.}

\item{model_name}{the coded model name that will determine the GPP_fun,
ER_fun, deficit_src, and ode_method to use in prediction}
}
\value{
a data.frame of predictions
}
\description{
Usually assigned to model_fun within mm_model_by_ply, called from there
}
