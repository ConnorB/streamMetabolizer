\usage{
mm_filter_valid_days(data, data_daily = NULL, day_start = 4,
  day_end = 27.99, day_tests = c("full_day", "even_timesteps",
  "complete_data", "pos_discharge"), timestep_days = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{data.frame of instantaneous observations, to be filtered to only 
those points on days that pass the specified tests in mm_is_valid_day}

\item{data_daily}{data.frame of daily estimates/statistics, to be filtered in
accordance with the filtering of data}

\item{day_start}{start time (inclusive) of a day's data in number of hours 
from the midnight that begins the date. For example, day_start=-1.5 
indicates that data describing 2006-06-26 begin at 2006-06-25 22:30, or at 
the first observation time that occurs after that time if day_start doesn't
fall exactly on an observation time. For metabolism models working with 
single days of input data, it is conventional/useful to begin the day the 
evening before, e.g., -1.5, and to end just before the next sunrise, e.g., 
30. For multiple consecutive days, it may make the most sense to start just
before sunrise (e.g., 4) and to end 24 hours later. For nighttime 
regression, the date assigned to a chunk of data should be the date whose 
evening contains the data. The default is therefore 12 to 36 for 
metab_night, of which the times of darkness will be used.}

\item{day_end}{end time (exclusive) of a day's data in number of hours from 
the midnight that begins the date. For example, day_end=30 indicates that 
data describing 2006-06-26 end at the last observation time that occurs 
before 2006-06-27 06:00. See day_start for recommended start and end times.}

\item{day_tests}{list of tests to conduct to determine whether each date 
worth of data is valid for modeling. the results of these tests will be 
passed to \code{model_fun} as the \code{ply_validity} argument to that 
function.}

\item{timestep_days}{TRUE if you would like the mean timestep length to be 
calculated for each data ply and passed to \code{model_fun} as the
\code{timestep_days} argument to that function. Alternatively, this may be
numeric as a specifically expected timestep length in days; for example, a
1-hour timestep is 1/24 is 0.0416667.}
}
\value{
list of data and data_daily with same structure as inputs but with 
  invalid days removed, plus a third data.frame of dates that were removed
}
\description{
Filter out any data rows that don't pass the specified tests for completeness
and regularity
