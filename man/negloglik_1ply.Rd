\title{Return the likelihood value for a given set of parameters and observations}
\usage{
negloglik_1ply(params, K600.daily, DO.obs, DO.sat, depth, temp.water, frac.GPP,
  frac.ER, frac.D, calc_DO_fun, ODE_method)
}
\arguments{
\item{params}{a vector of length 2, where the first element is GPP and the
second element is ER (both mg/L/d)}

\item{K600.daily}{optional - if K600 is to be fit, leave NULL. If K600 is to
be supplied, this is where to put it.}

\item{DO.obs}{a vector of observed DO, from which values at time t will be 
used to model values at time t+1}

\item{DO.sat}{dissolved oxygen concentrations if the water were at 
equilibrium saturation \eqn{mg O[2] L^{-1}}{mg O2 / L}. Calculate using 
\link{calc_DO_at_sat}}

\item{depth}{stream depth, \eqn{m}{m}.}

\item{temp.water}{stream temperature in degC}

\item{frac.GPP}{the fraction of daily GPP to apply to each timestep}

\item{frac.ER}{the fraction of daily ER to apply to each timestep}

\item{frac.D}{the fraction of daily D to apply to each timestep}

\item{calc_DO_fun}{the function to use to build DO estimates from GPP, ER,
etc. default is calc_DO_mod, but could also be calc_DO_mod_by_diff}

\item{ODE_method}{character specifying the numerical integration method to 
use. The default is pairmeans, where the change in DO between times t-1 and
t is a function of the mean DO.sat between times t-1 and t, mean temp.water
between times t-1 and t, mean light between times t-1 and t, etc. The Euler
method is currently more common in the literature, with each time step 
depending entirely on DO.sat, GPP, etc. at time t. Both methods are 
imprecise and fast, relative to Runge-Kutta or other numerical integration 
methods}

\description{
Called from mle_1ply(). From ?nlm, this function should be "the function to
be minimized, returning a single numeric value. This should be a function
with first argument a vector of the length of p followed by any other
arguments specified by the ... argument."
