\usage{
runstan_bayes(data_list, model_path, model_name, params_out, split_dates,
  keep_mcmc = FALSE, n_chains = 4, n_cores = 4, burnin_steps = 1000,
  saved_steps = 1000, thin_steps = 1, verbose = FALSE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{data_list}{a formatted list of inputs to the Stan model}

\item{model_path}{the Stan model file to use, as a full file path}

\item{model_name}{the coded model name, as from mm_name, giving the model
structure}

\item{params_out}{a character vector of parameters whose values in the MCMC 
runs should be recorded and summarized}

\item{keep_mcmc}{logical. If TRUE, the Stan output object will be saved. Be 
careful; these can be big, and a run with many models might overwhelm R's 
memory.}

\item{n_chains}{the number of chains to run}

\item{n_cores}{the number of cores to apply to this run}

\item{burnin_steps}{the number of steps per chain to run and ignore before 
starting to collect MCMC 'data'}

\item{saved_steps}{the number of MCMC steps per chain to save}

\item{thin_steps}{the number of steps to move before saving another step. 1 
means save all steps.}

\item{verbose}{logical. give status messages?}

\item{...}{ignored arguments}
