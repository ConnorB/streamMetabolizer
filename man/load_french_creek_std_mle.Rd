\usage{
load_french_creek_std_mle(
  french,
  K = 35,
  estimate = c("PRK", "K", "PR"),
  start = c(dates = "08/23/12", times = "22:00:00"),

)
}
\arguments{
\item{french}{the French Creek dataset}

\item{K}{optional. If specified, a number for the K600 to assume (units of 
1/d)}

\item{estimate}{character indicating the type of model to fit}

\item{start}{a character vector specifying the time at which the 'day' (the 
time period to use in producing an estimate for a single date) begins. The 
vector should have 2 elements, dates and times, to pass to chron()}

\item{end}{a character vector specifying the time at which the 'day' ends. 
The vector should have 2 elements, dates and times, to pass to chron()}

\item{plot}{logical - should plots be produced?}
}
\description{
Bob's code includes MLE and nighttime regression models. This function 
generates the output from those models, keeping the code as much intact as 
possible. The exception is that we're using solar.time rather than 
local.time, for consistency with streamMetabolizer's recommendations
}
\details{
This function requires the \code{chron} package, which is only suggested 
rather than required for the \code{streamMetabolizer} package. If you wish to
run this function, ensure that \code{chron} is installed or install it with 
\code{install.packages('chron')}.
