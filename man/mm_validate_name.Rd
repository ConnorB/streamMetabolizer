\title{Check the validity of a model name}
\usage{
mm_validate_name(model_name)
}
\arguments{
\item{model_name}{character string identifying the model features. Use 
\code{\link{mm_name}} for valid names. This may be a full model file path 
for custom Bayesian models, as long as basename(model_name) can still be 
parsed correctly with \code{mm_parse_name()}. In that case the file may be 
specified either as a file path relative to the streamMetabolizer models 
directory (the first assumption; this directory can be found with 
\code{system.file("models", package="streamMetabolizer")}) or as an 
absolute path or a path relative to the current working directory (the 
second assumption, if the first assumption turns up no files of the given 
name).}
}
\description{
Check the syntactic & scientific validity of a model name. Returns the model
name if it's valid, otherwise gives an error
}
\examples{
mm_validate_name("b_np_oipi_pm_plrckm.stan")
\dontrun{
mm_validate_name("b_np_oipn") # throws error
}
