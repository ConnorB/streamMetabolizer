\usage{
data_metab(
  num_days = c("1", "3", "10"),
  res = c("5", "10", "15", "30"),
  flaws = c("missing middle", "missing start", "missing end", "missorted",
    "duplicated"),

)
}
\arguments{
\item{num_days}{the number of days to include in the data. character format 
because only certain numbers of days are permitted (see defaults in Usage 
for the accepted options)}

\item{res}{character specifying the desired resolution of the data in minutes
(character; see defaults in Usage for the accepted options)}

\item{flaws}{character specifying one or more flaws to include in the data, or
empty (\code{c()}) for no flaws. default is no flaws.}

\item{day_start}{start time (inclusive) of a day's data in number of hours 
from the midnight that begins the date. For example, day_start=-1.5 
indicates that data describing 2006-06-26 begin at 2006-06-25 22:30, or at 
the first observation time that occurs after that time if day_start doesn't
fall exactly on an observation time. For metabolism models working with 
single days of input data, it is conventional/useful to begin the day the 
evening before, e.g., -1.5, and to end just before the next sunrise, e.g., 
30. For multiple consecutive days, it may make the most sense to start just
before sunrise (e.g., 4) and to end 24 hours later. For nighttime 
regression, the date assigned to a chunk of data should be the date whose 
evening contains the data. The default is therefore 12 to 36 for 
metab_night, of which the times of darkness will be used.}

\item{day_end}{end time (exclusive) of a day's data in number of hours from 
the midnight that begins the date. For example, day_end=30 indicates that 
data describing 2006-06-26 end at the last observation time that occurs 
before 2006-06-27 06:00. See day_start for recommended start and end times.}

\item{attach.units}{logical. Should units be attached to the data.frame?}
