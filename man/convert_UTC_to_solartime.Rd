\title{Convert DateTime from UTC to local solar time}
\usage{
convert_UTC_to_solartime(
  date.time,
  longitude,
  time.type = c("apparent solar", "mean solar")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{date.time}{date-time values in POSIXct format and UTC timezone.}

\item{longitude}{numeric, in degrees, either positive and unitted ("degE" or 
"degW") or with sign indicating direction (positive = East)}

\item{time.type}{character. "apparent solar", i.e. true solar time, is noon 
when the sun is at its zenith. "mean solar" approximates apparent solar 
time but with noons exactly 24 hours apart. Elsewhere in this package,
variables named "solar.time" are mean solar time, whereas "app.solar.time"
is apparent solar and "any.solar.time" is either.}
}
\value{
a POSIXct object that says it's in tz="UTC" but that's actually in 
  solar time, with noon being very close to solar noon
}
\description{
Convert DateTime from UTC to local solar time, which may be either apparent 
solar (perfect match between noon and solar zenith) or mean solar (exactly 24
hours between solar noons).
