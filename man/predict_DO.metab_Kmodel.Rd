\title{Override generic predict_DO for metab_Kmodel, which can't predict DO}
\usage{
\method{predict_DO}{metab_Kmodel}(metab_model, date_start = NA,
  date_end = NA, ..., use_saved = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{metab_model}{A metabolism model, implementing the 
metab_model_interface, to use in predicting metabolism}

\item{date_start}{Date or a class convertible with as.Date. The first date 
(inclusive) for which to report DO predictions. If NA, no filtering is 
done.}

\item{date_end}{Date or a class convertible with as.Date. The last date 
(inclusive) for which to report DO predictions. If NA, no filtering is 
done.}

\item{...}{Other arguments passed to class-specific implementations of 
\code{predict_DO}}

\item{use_saved}{logical. Is it OK to use predictions that were saved with 
the model?}
}
\description{
metab_Kmodel predicts K at daily timesteps and usually knows nothing about 
GPP or ER. So it's not possible to predict DO from this model. Try passing 
the output to metab_mle and THEN predicting DO.
