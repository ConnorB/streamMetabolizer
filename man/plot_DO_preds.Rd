\title{Plot predictions produced with predict_DO}
\usage{
plot_DO_preds(
  DO_preds,
  y_var = c("conc", "pctsat", "ddodt"),
  style = c("ggplot2", "dygraphs"),
  y_lim = list(conc = c(NA, NA), pctsat = c(NA, NA), ddodt = c(NA, NA)),
  date_start = NA,
  date_end = NA,
  use_saved = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{DO_preds}{a data.frame of predictions such as that returned by 
predict_DO()}

\item{y_var}{character. Should the plot display predicted & observed values 
in concentration (conc) or as percent of saturation (pctsat)? The default 
is to plot both.}

\item{style}{character indicating which graphics package to use}

\item{y_lim}{list of named vectors, each of which has length 2 and is numeric
and has a name in the possible values of y_var. NA within a vector
indicates that the data range should be used. for ggplot2, y_lim is only
used to exclude values outside that range and is ignored if the data span a
narrower range}

\item{date_start}{Date or a class convertible with as.Date. The first date 
(inclusive) for which to report DO predictions. If NA, no filtering is 
done.}

\item{date_end}{Date or a class convertible with as.Date. The last date 
(inclusive) for which to report DO predictions. If NA, no filtering is 
done.}

\item{use_saved}{logical. Is it OK to use predictions that were saved with 
the model?}
}
\description{
Plots modeled values as lines, observed values as points
