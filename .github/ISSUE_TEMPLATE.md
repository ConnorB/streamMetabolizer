Thanks for submitting your issue or question. We can address issues fastest if they are:

* New - search past issues first to see if your question has already been answered. Reopen an old issue if your question was almost but not quite answered.

* Complete - share all relevant code and console output/errors/warnings, in the order they were run and produced on your computer. Also include the output from a call to `devtools::session_info()` to tell us about your computer's configuration.

* Reproducible - include all the data and code necessary for us/others to recreate the problem locally. It's fine to make up data if you can't share yours, as long as the problem still comes through.

* Minimal - what is the smallest amount of data and code you can use to demonstrate the problem? This is less essential than the others but improves communication and our response time.
